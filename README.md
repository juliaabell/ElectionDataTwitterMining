# Final project submission


Use this project for interacting with your group. I suggest you to keep the folders updated (especially the one containing). I also suggest to use the `issue` feature in github for communicating with your teammates since that way it will be easier to debug your code.

For each deadline I will count as submitted the files uploaded in the corresponding folder. Use:

- into the `intro_presentation` folder for your initial presentation introducing your project (deadline 11/19)

- into the `documentation` folder for your full documentation (deadline 11/26). If you like the Markdown syntax more you can modify this README.md file for providing the documentation of your project

- into the `code` folder upload the project's code (deadline 12/11)

- into the `final_presentation` folder upload the final presentation at least one day before the actual discussion (date to arrange with the instructor)
