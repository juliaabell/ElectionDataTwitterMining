# Final project submission


Use this project for interacting with your group. I suggest you to keep the folders updated (especially the one containing). I also suggest to use the `issue` feature in github for communicating with your teammates since that way it will be easier to debug your code.

For each deadline I will count as submitted the files uploaded in the corresponding folder.

Use:

- the `intro_presentation` folder for your initial presentation introducing your project (**deadline 11/19**)

- the `documentation` folder for your full documentation (**deadline 11/26**). If you like the Markdown syntax you can modify this README.md file for providing the documentation of your project. A tutorial can be found [here](https://www.markdowntutorial.com)

- the `code` folder upload the project's code (**deadline 12/11**)

- the `final_presentation` folder upload the final presentation at least one day before the actual discussion (date to arrange with the instructor)
